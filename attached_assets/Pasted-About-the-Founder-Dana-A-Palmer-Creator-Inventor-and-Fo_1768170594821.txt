About the Founder

Dana A. Palmer

Creator, Inventor, and Founder of Tree-Lance

Tree-Lance was founded by Dana A. Palmer after identifying a rare and consequential gap in a critical global industry: professional tree services operating almost entirely outside modern digital infrastructure.

For decades, arborists and tree service professionals have performed essential, high-risk work that protects communities, restores environments after disasters, and preserves urban ecosystems. Yet despite the importance of this work, the industry remained fragmented—reliant on word-of-mouth, paper estimates, outdated classifieds, and inconsistent standards—while nearly every other service sector evolved into scalable, technology-enabled marketplaces.

Dana Palmer saw what others overlooked: not a small inefficiency, but a systemic failure.

Seeing the Opportunity Others Missed

Tree services sit at the intersection of public safety, environmental stewardship, emergency response, and infrastructure protection. Despite this, the industry lacked:
	•	Centralized digital marketplaces
	•	Standardized trust and verification systems
	•	Scalable disaster-response coordination
	•	Modern payment, scheduling, and compliance tools
	•	Global visibility and economic leverage for skilled workers

Dana recognized that this was not simply a business opportunity—it was a responsibility.

In 2024, she formally patented the Tree-Lance platform concept, securing the intellectual foundation for a technology ecosystem designed specifically for the tree service and arboriculture industry. This marked the transition from vision to execution.

From Personal Adversity to Global Vision

Dana Palmer’s life story is not one of privilege—it is one of endurance, survival, and transformation. Her journey through profound personal adversity forged an uncommon clarity: systems matter, access matters, and dignity in work matters.

Tree-Lance is the culmination of that realization.

What began as a solution to modernize an overlooked trade evolved into something larger: a framework for economic fairness, environmental responsibility, and global coordination during moments of crisis.

Building More Than a Company

Tree-Lance is not merely an app. It is a platform designed to:
	•	Empower independent contractors without exploiting them
	•	Elevate safety and accountability across borders
	•	Enable rapid disaster response during storms, fires, and climate events
	•	Create economic stability in regions where skilled labor is undervalued
	•	Restore trust between service providers and communities

Under Dana Palmer’s leadership, Tree-Lance is structured not as a short-term startup, but as a long-horizon, self-made global corporation—engineered for scale, resilience, and generational impact.

A Vision That Extends Beyond Profit

While Tree-Lance is built to become one of the most valuable technology enterprises in the world, its purpose reaches further than revenue.

At its core, Tree-Lance is about alignment:
	•	Between humans and nature
	•	Between labor and dignity
	•	Between technology and responsibility

By creating systems that reduce chaos, improve coordination, and reward ethical work, Tree-Lance contributes to something larger—stability. And stability is the foundation of peace.

A Beginning, Not an Ending

Tree-Lance represents the beginning of a new chapter—not only for an industry, but for how technology can be applied to sectors that quietly hold the world together.

Dana Palmer’s work stands as proof that innovation does not require permission, that overlooked industries hold the greatest potential, and that even from the hardest beginnings, something capable of serving the world can be built.
