Understood. Below is a clear, execution-ready roadmap—no fluff, no theory—focused on making Tree-Lance stronger, safer, and more valuable fast.

Top 5 Features to Build First (Highest ROI)

These directly drive adoption, revenue, and trust.
	1.	AI Photo-Based Estimates
Homeowners upload photos → AI generates price range + scope.
Impact: Higher conversion, fewer abandoned jobs.
	2.	Escrow-Style Payments via Stripe
Funds authorized upfront, released at completion milestones.
Impact: Reduces disputes, protects both sides, increases confidence.
	3.	Verified Contractor Tiers (Bronze / Silver / Gold)
Ranking based on insurance, history, safety, and reviews.
Impact: Self-policing quality without employment risk.
	4.	Mandatory Job Documentation (Before / After)
Geotagged, timestamped photo requirements.
Impact: Legal protection, fewer chargebacks, stronger trust.
	5.	Emergency / Storm Mode
Priority matching, surge logic, disaster tagging.
Impact: Massive revenue spikes when demand explodes.

12-Month Build Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation (Months 0–3)

Goal: Make the marketplace solid and trustworthy.
	•	Core job posting + contractor matching
	•	Stripe payments with 20% auto-split
	•	Contractor verification (insurance, license upload)
	•	Ratings & reviews
	•	Basic GPS mapping

This is your minimum investor-credible product.

⸻

Phase 2: Conversion & Control (Months 4–6)

Goal: Increase bookings and reduce friction.
	•	AI photo estimates (price range, risk flags)
	•	Escrow-style payment flow
	•	Required before/after documentation
	•	Contractor tier system
	•	In-app messaging with job timeline

This is where Tree-Lance becomes reliable, not just usable.

⸻

Phase 3: Differentiation (Months 7–9)

Goal: Separate from competitors.
	•	Emergency / Storm Mode
	•	Risk & safety scoring
	•	Route optimization for contractors
	•	Homeowner job tracking dashboard

Now you’re building preference, not just awareness.

⸻

Phase 4: Moat Building (Months 10–12)

Goal: Long-term defensibility.
	•	Tree history “system of record”
	•	Maintenance subscriptions
	•	Insurance-ready documentation exports
	•	Municipal / HOA pilot dashboards

This is where Tree-Lance stops being an app and starts being infrastructure.

⸻

Hard Truth (Important)

Tree-Lance does not win by being futuristic first.
It wins by being boringly reliable, then quietly powerful.

AI, AR, drones, smart glasses—those matter after:
	•	Payments are frictionless
	•	Trust is enforceable
	•	Jobs close cleanly

You’re thinking at the right scale. The discipline is sequencing.

I can:
	1.	Turn this into a 1-page investor roadmap
	2.	Create a pitch-deck slide explaining this strategy
	3.	Reduce this to a “what we’re building now vs later” statement
	4.	Translate this into engineering tickets / feature specs
