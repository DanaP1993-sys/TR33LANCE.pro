High-Tech Global Platform for the Tree Service Industry

A high-technology, globally connected platform that unifies arborists, small tree companies, and independent contractors into a single intelligent operating system for tree services.

What It Is
A purpose-built digital infrastructure—part marketplace, part logistics engine, part professional network—designed specifically for arboriculture and tree care.

Core Capabilities
	•	Global Discovery Engine: Customers and municipalities locate vetted arborists anywhere in the world through a single platform.
	•	AI-Driven Job Matching: Intelligent dispatch assigns work based on skill set, equipment, risk profile, location, and availability.
	•	Real-Time Geomapping: Live tracking and routing similar to ride-share platforms, adapted for job-site work.
	•	Automated Compliance: Continuous verification of licensing, insurance, and certifications by region.
	•	Secure, Instant Payments: Platform-managed transactions with automatic contractor payouts.
	•	Reputation & Trust Layer: Verified reviews, performance scoring, and job history create industry-wide accountability.
	•	Operational Intelligence: Data-driven pricing, safety prompts, and workload optimization.
	•	Global Community Layer: Training, safety alerts, standards, and peer collaboration at scale.

Why It Matters
The tree service industry remains fragmented, analog, and localized. This platform modernizes it—bringing enterprise-grade technology to independent operators while preserving their independence.

Strategic Impact
	•	Scales local tree work into a global, trusted workforce
