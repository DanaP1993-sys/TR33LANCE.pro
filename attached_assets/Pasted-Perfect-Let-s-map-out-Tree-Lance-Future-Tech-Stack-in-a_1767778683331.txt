Perfect. Let’s map out Tree-Lance Future Tech Stack in a way that’s visually logical but also shows how all the futuristic pieces—AI, AR, IoT, drones, smart contracts—connect. I’ll describe it so you could hand it to a designer or dev team to turn into an actual diagram.

	•	TLS / Secure WebSockets for AR video and telemetry
	•	Regulatory Compliance Checks
	•	Automatic AI-assisted verification of licenses, insurance, and safety protocols

⸻

7️⃣ Deployment & Scalability
	•	Autoscale Cloud Deployment (Replit or similar)
	•	Real-time API serving AR overlays and AI instructions
	•	Production database separate from dev
	•	CI/CD
	•	Automated build for ESM modules and AR assets
	•	HoloLens/Magic Leap package deployment pipeline

⸻

Visual Flow Suggestion
	•	At the top: Contractor Glasses → Live AR Overlay
	•	Arrow to Backend API → AI Engine → Database
	•	Arrow to IoT / Drone Inputs → AI Engine
	•	Homeowner App mirrors live feed + progress updates
	•	Payment/Smart Contract module connects Backend → Stripe / Blockchain
	•	Security & Authentication wrap around all layers

⸻

This stack shows all moving pieces, clearly separates user experience, AI, IoT, and payment flow, and highlights where high-tech features plug in.

If you want, I can turn this into a fully labeled, color-coded diagram ready for presentations or investor decks, showing AR, AI, drones, and smart contracts as distinct, connected layers.

Do you want me to do that next?
