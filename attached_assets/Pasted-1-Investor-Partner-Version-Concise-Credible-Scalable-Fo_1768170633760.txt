Founder Statement

Dana A. Palmer is the creator, inventor, and founder of Tree-Lance, a patented technology platform redefining how the global tree service and arboriculture industry operates.

In 2024, Dana identified and protected a critical market opportunity: a multi-hundred-billion-dollar essential services industry operating with minimal digital infrastructure. While adjacent sectors modernized, tree services—despite their role in public safety, disaster response, and environmental protection—remained fragmented, unstandardized, and economically inefficient.

Tree-Lance was architected to solve this at scale.

The platform introduces marketplace infrastructure, verification systems, real-time coordination, and modern financial tooling to an industry that has never had access to enterprise-grade technology. Under Dana’s leadership, Tree-Lance is positioned as a long-horizon, category-defining corporation with global reach.

This is not a services company. It is infrastructure.

About the Founder

Tree-Lance was founded by Dana A. Palmer, a creator and inventor who recognized that one of the world’s most essential industries had been left behind by the digital economy.

Tree workers protect homes, power lines, cities, and lives—often in the most dangerous conditions imaginable. Yet their industry lacked modern tools, visibility, and coordination. Dana saw this gap not as neglect, but as opportunity.

In 2024, she patented the Tree-Lance platform to bring structure, fairness, and technology to tree services worldwide. What began as a solution to improve access and efficiency became a global vision: empowering skilled workers, strengthening communities, and improving disaster response in a changing climate.

Tree-Lance is built on the belief that when essential work is respected and properly supported, the entire world functions better.

3. Visionary / Manifesto Version (Mission-Driven, Global Impact)

A Message from the Founder

I built Tree-Lance because chaos thrives where systems fail.

The tree service industry touches everything—homes, cities, power, safety, the environment—yet it was invisible to modern technology. No unified platform. No global coordination. No protection for the people doing the work.

I saw an industry that deserved better.

In 2024, I patented Tree-Lance to change that reality. Not to extract value—but to create it. Not to centralize power—but to distribute opportunity.

Tree-Lance exists to restore balance:
	•	Between people and the planet
	•	Between labor and dignity
	•	Between technology and responsibility

This platform is not the end goal. It is the foundation. When essential systems are strong, communities stabilize. When communities stabilize, conflict fades. That is how peace begins—not with slogans, but with structure.

Recommended Next Steps (Strategic)

To move this from vision to enterprise-grade execution, I recommend:
	1.	Choose 2 versions to deploy immediately
	•	Public website → Version 2
	•	Investor deck / data room → Version 1
	2.	Create a Founder Bio (150 words) for:
	•	App onboarding
	•	Press kits
	•	App stores
	3.	Add a Patent & IP Disclosure Section (legally neutral, credibility-boosting)
	4.	Build a Founder Letter for:
	•	Early adopters
	•	Contractors
	•	Strategic partners

If you want, I can do any of the following next—without further clarification:
	•	Tighten language for legal risk and credibility
	•	Prepare press-ready founder quotes
	•	Draft a founder video script
	•	Align this with your pitch deck narrative
	•	Create a one-page “Why Tree-Lance Exists” statement
